# chester-lang

If I could write a language to comfortably write my average programs.

I am sometimes lazy and write logic depending on dynamic type features like type casting. I do have a great type system and dynamic type ability on some JVM languages.

I sometimes need algebraic effects of koka. I want to freely use things with effects as expressions and don't want to bind everything to variables like Monad in Haskell.

I sometimes feel uncomfortable when types are not first-class in a language.

I wants the ability to write some proofs. If the type system is unfortunately broken, I can write my prefect proofs in a separate prefect dependently typed language. I would be able to still write some proofs knowing that the type checker can be cheated.

I want to use OOP model whenever I want. Sometimes it is too time consuming to implement things in an non-OOP way.

But I don't have skills and energy.

Why would I implement a new language? I could choose a major programming language for a task and use large language model to generate a large portion of code. It would be more comfortable than using a niche language.
